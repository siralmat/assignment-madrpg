# MADrpg: Android/Kotlin RPG with Android Architecture Components
![Travel screen](travel_screen.png)
This repo contains my submission for my Mobile Application Development class in Semester 2 2018.

The assignment goal was to create a simple tile-based game with randomly generated areas and database persistence (full specification [here](assignment-spec.pdf)).

I chose to implement the assignment in Kotlin, following the official Android recommendation of a [MVVM app architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide#recommended-app-arch).

Some things you'll find in the code:
* **Room** database interaction
* Players, items, and areas stored in **LiveData** objects
* Fragment/activity updates through **ViewModels**
* **RecyclerView** item lists (with **DiffUtil** to handle updates efficiently)
* At least four major bugs, try to find them all!

At the time of writing this app, there weren't many examples of games using the Android Architecture Componentsâ€”particularly in Kotlin! The end result is far from perfect, but I hope it's an interesting read for anyone wondering how (not) to implement game functionality in a modern Android app architecture.
